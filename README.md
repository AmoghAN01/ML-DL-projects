The projects:

1]Credit card Dimensionality Reduction using Autoencoders
This project implements an autoencoder for dimensionality reduction on the "Default of Credit Card Clients" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset consists of 30,000 samples with 24 features related to credit card usage and default prediction. The autoencoder architecture compresses the input features from 24 to 16 dimensions while preserving key information, achieving a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0011 and an RÂ² score of approximately 0.66 on both training and test datasets. The use of MinMaxScaler for feature scaling, along with techniques like LeakyReLU activation and dropout for regularization, ensures effective training and generalization. Overall, the model demonstrates a successful reduction in dimensionality while retaining significant variance from the original dataset.

2]Customer segmentation
