Title:Online Food Ordering Behavior Analysis

Project Overview

This project aims to analyze online food ordering behavior using a dataset of customer demographics, location, and order details. The analysis involves exploring relationships between various factors and order status, as well as predicting customer preferences based on their attributes.

The Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is named "onlinefoods.csv". It contains information about customer demographics, location details, and online food ordering behavior.

Methodology

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing:The dataset is loaded using Pandas, and basic data exploration and cleaning steps are performed, including handling missing values and converting categorical variables to numerical representations using Label Encoding.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizations and cross-tabulations are used to explore relationships between demographic/location factors and online food ordering behavior.

3. Predictive Modeling:A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model is trained to predict customer preferences or behavior based on demographic and location attributes.

Results

- Exploratory Analysis: Insights gained from the analysis include identifying relationships between monthly income, age, gender, marital status, occupation, education, family size, and location with online food ordering behavior.

- Predictive Modeling:The KNN model achieves an accuracy of abpout 89% in predicting customer behavior.

Future Work

- Explore other machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling.
- Feature engineering to derive new variables for improved model performance.
- Incorporate external data sources to enrich the analysis.
